# WASM Parser

WASM Parser is a tool to parse WebAssembly binaries.

I am creating this tool to help me gain a better understanding of WASM. Therefore, the code is focused on clarity rather than efficiency.

# â–¶ Usage

*wasmdump* is the executable that parses the wasm.

```bash
wasmdump path/to/wasm
```


# ðŸ”¨ Build this tool

Very easy to build! Just do a `cargo build`.

```bash
cargo build
```

*wasmdump* is in `target/debug/` directory.

```bash
cp target/debug/wasmdump any/path
```
